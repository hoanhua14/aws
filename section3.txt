what is cloud computing?
- on-demand delivery of compute power (AWS lambda), database storage (S3 buckets), applications, and other IT resources.
- pay-as-you-go
- flexibility in resources based on your need (many servers available to use), time (ready to use within seconds)
- user-friendly console interface

5 Characteristics of cloud computing
- on-demand self service (you can set up and run it on your own without interacting with service provider)
- broad network access (many resources and services available )
- multi-tenancy and resource pooling (many customers can share the same cloud infrastructures)
- rapid elasticity and scalability (can scale out and in as needed)
- measured service (pay only for what you used)

6 pros
- pay on-demand, no need to pay for hardware
- many other AWS users => price is adjusted to lower
- no need to guess the capacity that you need
- increase speed and agility
- no need maintanence
- go global in minutes

problems solved by using cloud
- flexibility: you can change resources as you need
- cost-effectiveness: pay as you go
- scalability
- elasticity
- high availability and fault-tolerance
- agility: rapid develop, test, and launch
